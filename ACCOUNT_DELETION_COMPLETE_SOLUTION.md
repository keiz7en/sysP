# Complete Account Deletion Solution

## 🎯 Objective

Implement comprehensive account deletion functionality where:

- **Students and Teachers** can delete their own accounts
- **Teachers** can delete student accounts
- **Admins** can delete student and teacher accounts
- All related data is properly cleaned up

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API Implementation

#### Self-Deletion Endpoint (`/api/users/delete-account/`)

```python
@api_view(['DELETE'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def delete_account(request):
    """Delete user's own account - Available to all user types"""
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Available to Students, Teachers, and Admins
- ✅ Requires confirmation string: `"delete {username}"`
- ✅ Comprehensive data cleanup (profiles, enrollments, assessments, analytics)
- ✅ Atomic transactions for data integrity
- ✅ Proper token invalidation

#### Admin/Teacher Deletion Endpoint (`/api/users/delete-user/{user_id}/`)

```python
@api_view(['DELETE'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def delete_user_account(request, user_id):
    """Delete another user's account - Admin can delete any, Teacher can delete students"""
```

**Permission Matrix:**

- ✅ **Admins**: Can delete students and teachers (not other admins)
